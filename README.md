# oneclickdoc

The One Click Doc project is a Chrome extension that opens a Google Doc, Sheet, Slide, Drawings, Meeting, Keep Note, Meet -- almost anything connected to Google Drive.

These were published in the Chrome Web Store and Google pulled them down. I am releasing them to the public so people can learn about extensions and build more functionality off the very basic base I started with.
